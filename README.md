Partial function application.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/reactphp/curry.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/reactphp/curry)

## Deprecated

This library is deprecated and has been replaced with `react/partial`. The
reason is that the library does not actually implement currying, it does
partial function application.
